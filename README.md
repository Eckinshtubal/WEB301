This repository will serve as the starting point for each week, providing:

* Links to reading and educational materials

**Important**: Due to the dynamic, fast-moving nature of the topics covered in this class, there is no text book for this class. Instead, each topic will be covered in class, with additional reading materials provided in this repository.
