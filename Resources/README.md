**IMPORTANT**: There are two options for working with Sass in the WEB301 class - **EITHER OPTIONAL IS PERFECTLY FINE**. The hard requirement for the class is using Sass, either method below will allow this.

If in doubt, you should be using option 1.

## Option 1: Sass commands in terminal

If you are comfortable using Sass in the terminal as we did in class for weeks 1, 2 and 3, then use the **sass-workflow**.

You can download this folder directly [here](sass-workflow.zip).

## Option 2: Using Sass with Gulp

If you are comfortable using Gulp to build your files, then use the **gulp-workflow**.

You can download this folder directly [here](gulp-workflow.zip).
