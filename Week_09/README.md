# Week #9

1. Download the [exercise.zip](exercise.zip) file.
2. The folder is basically the Gulp Workflow folder we have been using, but with some changes. Install and get up and running as you have previously.
3. There are 5 image files stored within the `app` folder.
4. **WITHOUT MOVING** any files, link to these files and display them all within the HTML file.

 - First use absolute paths.
 - Then use relative paths.
 
One of them is tricky, so be careful!
