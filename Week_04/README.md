# Week #4

This boilerplate provides a basic starting point for front end web development.

Included software:

* Sass
* BrowserSync
* Gulp
* AutoPrefixer

The boilerplate is built to provide the following features:

* Automated processing of Sass files
* Automatic vendor prefixing
* Automated minification of CSS and JavaScript files
* Automatic browser refresh on save
* BrowserSync tools for CSS debugging

## Requirements

In order to run the boilerplate there is really only one requirement - you must have Node installed, which should include the Node Package Manager (NPM).

This can be downloaded and installed on Macs and Windows by visiting the Node [website](https://nodejs.org/en/) and downloading the recommended version for your system. If you have trouble with this, email me and I will provide guidance.

## Installation

Once you have Node installed, test this in your command line (Terminal) by entering this command:

`npm`

If you see an error message, Node was not correctly installed. If you see a list of options for how to use NPM then installation was successful and you should be able to follow these steps:

1. Download this GitHub repository
2. Navigate to the week #4 folder by running: `cd /location/of/folder/`
3. Run the command `npm install`
4. After the dependencies have been installed you should see no error messages.
5. Run the command: `npm run gulp`

A browser window should open displaying the HTML file. You can test that everything worked by making changes - **IMPORTANT**: make your changes to the Sass and JavaScript files in the `src` folder, **NOT** the files in the `app` folder - this is where files are stored after they have been processed, any changes you make here will be wiped out.

Email me if you have any questions!
